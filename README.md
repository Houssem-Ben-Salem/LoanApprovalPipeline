Loan Approval Prediction MLOps Pipeline

This repository implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for a Loan Approval Prediction system. The project automates data fetching, model training, containerization, CI/CD deployment, and model monitoring using tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Evidently AI.

🚀 Features

	1.	CI/CD Automation:
	•	Automated builds, tests, and deployments using GitHub Actions.
	•	Continuous deployment to Google Cloud Run.
	2.	Model Development:
	•	Training pipeline with support for hyperparameter tuning.
	•	Support for state-of-the-art models like XGBoost and CatBoost.
	3.	Monitoring:
	•	Integrated with Evidently AI for monitoring data drift and model performance.
	•	Logging and metrics tracking using Google Cloud Monitoring.
	4.	Containerization:
	•	Dockerized application for scalable deployment.
	•	Support for both training and inference containers.
	5.	Feedback Loop:
	•	Gradio-based feedback interface to improve model predictions.
	•	Automated retraining with user feedback.

📦 Installation

	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-mlops.git
cd loan-approval-mlops


	2.	Set Up Python Environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Set Up GCP Authentication:
	•	Save the GCP service account key as a base64-encoded secret (GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY) in GitHub.
	•	Locally, copy the key to /tmp/key.json:

cp loanapprovalprediction-442813-de39e566af07.json /tmp/key.json
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/key.json


	4.	Build and Run the Docker Container Locally:

docker build -t loan-approval-pipeline .
docker run -p 8080:8080 loan-approval-pipeline

🚀 Usage

1. Run the Inference Service Locally:

cd app
python gradio_inference.py

Access the Gradio app at http://localhost:8080.

2. Train the Model:

Run the training pipeline:

python src/pipeline/run_pipeline.py

🌐 CI/CD Pipeline

Workflow: train-pipeline.yml

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the CI/CD process:
	1.	Fetches the latest dataset from Google Cloud Storage.
	2.	Builds and pushes the Docker image to GCP Artifact Registry.
	3.	Deploys the image to Google Cloud Run.

Trigger: Push to main branch.

🔍 Monitoring

Data and Concept Drift

	•	Integrated with Evidently AI to detect:
	•	Data drift.
	•	Target distribution changes.
	•	Feature importance changes.

Access Monitoring Reports:

Reports are generated and stored locally as monitoring_report.html.

🔄 Feedback Loop

	•	Modify Predictions: Users can review and modify model predictions via the Gradio app.
	•	Save Feedback: Updated records are saved to Google Cloud Storage for retraining.

🧪 Testing

	•	Unit Tests: Add tests to validate individual components.
	•	Integration Tests: Ensure end-to-end functionality of the pipeline.

Example:

pytest tests/

🌐 Deployment

	1.	Deploy Training Pipeline:

gcloud run deploy loan-approval-training \
    --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/loan-approval-repo/loan-approval-pipeline \
    --platform managed \
    --allow-unauthenticated


	2.	Deploy Inference Service:

gcloud run deploy loan-approval-inference \
    --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/loan-approval-repo/inference-service \
    --platform managed \
    --allow-unauthenticated

🔧 Future Enhancements

	1.	Add Model Explainability:
	•	Integrate SHAP or LIME to explain model predictions.
	2.	Improve Feedback Loop:
	•	Automate retraining based on user feedback.
	3.	Add Experiment Tracking:
	•	Integrate tools like Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.
	4.	Integrate Alerts:
	•	Set up Google Cloud Monitoring to notify on anomalies.
